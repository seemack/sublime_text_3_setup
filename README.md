# sublime_text_3_setup

This is the repo for my personal (and ever-changing) Sublime Text 3 setup.

If you like it, feel free to beg, borrow & steal what you like.


Keep your local Sublime Text user folder synched with this repo.

Most likely that's C:\Users\[your_user_name]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User.

Set this repo as a remote. Since you're likely to have an existing User folder, I suggest blitzing it (`rm -r User`) and cloning this repo as the new User folder.
`git clone https://github.com/seemack/sublime_text_3_setup User`
